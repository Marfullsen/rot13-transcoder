## Description

[Site](https://Marfullsen.github.io/rot13-transcoder/) for encrypting and decrypting ciphertext with [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).

---

## History

ROT13 is a special case of the encryption algorithm known as a Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC

---

## How it works

The cipher consists of replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter that is thirteen positions ahead, thus, each letter would be as follows:

| Input | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz |
| --- | --- |
| Output | NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm |

An example of the use of encryption would be:

__The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.__
